Do not install this gem. It contains a malicious code.

It was made to be a demonstration at this blog post: [http://netengine.com.au/blog/ruby-conf-australia-2013-in-review-hacking-with-gems/](http://netengine.com.au/blog/ruby-conf-australia-2013-in-review-hacking-with-gems/)

It will post your ``whoami`` command to this URL [http://cryptic-ocean-8847.herokuapp.com/usernames](http://cryptic-ocean-8847.herokuapp.com/usernames).
